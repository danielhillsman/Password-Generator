When the red oval that contains "Generate Password" is clicked by user
a prompt will pop up asking, "How many characters would you like?"

---The Alert Message---
NOTE: If the user selects any number that is less than or greater,
than it will have a prompt pop up asking,
"Please select from 8 to 128 characters..."
And then it will end the function.
NOTE: This will keep happening to the user, until user selects the correct numbers from 8-128.

Once the user selects a number from 8-128,
A prompt will pop up asking "Do you want uppercase in your password?"
"OK" for yes, "Cancel" for no.

After that, another prompt will ask,
"Do you want lowercase letters?
"OK" for yes, "Cancel" for no.

After that, another prompt will ask,
"Do you want numbers?"
"OK" for yes, "Cancel" for no.

After that, another prompt will ask,
How about any special characters?
"OK" for yes, "Cancel" for no.

---End of Function---

Once the last question is answered, the password will generate randomly on all characters.
The only variable that is not randomly generated is the ammount of characters the user chooses.
